# This is complicated enough to sketch the algorithm before writing code (shocker!)
# Given a list of cells, sources, and measurements (with some wacky options thrown in), we want to generate
# all of the "background" data necessary to build those cells automatically, e.g. generate the surfaces necessary to build the cells.
# To that end, we divide the options into "cell-like," "source-like," and "tally-like," and require their specification in the initialization of the
# object of the corresponding type. This is natural: why should the surfaces I only think about in the context of one or two cells be specified separately?
# There do exist options that don't satisfy this natural classification: transforms come to mind, as they may be used in surface, source, or
# "backend" contexts.

# The user specifies a list of sources, a list of cells, and a list of tallies
# we reconstruct the input file by first going through every "PHITSable" property
# and generating a digraph of the distinct values (up to the equivalence relation of each class's __eq__), with adjacency x → y denoting
# "y needs x for its definition." This is necessary because we don't want to duplicate definitions, but we want to retain the connection
# of parent-child; we need to define two parents with __eq__ children in terms of /one/ .inp line representing the child.
# The set of values of each type are enumerated, and the graph updated to reflect each object's enumeration, representing the order in which the objects will appear in the input file.
# We can now use the child's enumeration in the definition of the parent, which is what we're after.

# In effect, we take the graph of Python object relationships, apply an algorithm that collapses __eq__ nodes into each other while retaining adjacency, (this seems like an extant problem, I just don't know its name)
# map nodes → (idx, nodes) where idx is the result of enumerating all nodes that end up in the same PHITS section, and write it all out.

# The first algorithm is, actually, best implemented by creating an explicit graph, as anything I can think of is formally equivalent to that. However, it may be space-inefficient, as the adjacency data is represented twice.
# The naïve algorithm is suboptimal: taking every node, and comparing it to every other node to construct the equivalence class explicitly is O(n^n), and doesn't use symmetry or transitivity to reduce the number of required comparisons.

# Here's a better candidate algorithm: first, initialize an empty set (since we only need lookup and insertion we can get O(1) on average; the hash values are computed via the equivalence relation in question).
# Iterate over the nodes of the graph; if the a node isn't in the set (i.e. is not equivalent to any in the set, since the hash bins are computed via __eq__), add it.
# If a node is equivalent to one in the set, change all edges that end on the node to end instead on the one to which it is equivalent.
# This is O(#nodes + connectivity)


# sources is list of tuples of a Source value and a numeric weight, cells is a list of Cell values,
# and
